Goal of this fork
-------------------------

* modifying the x-end idler to more solid, right now the ball-bearing mount it's a predetermined breaking point.
* modifying the wood frame fins to fit the i3 EINSTEIN Rework y-corners
* modifying the y-carrier for 3-point leveling AND for triggering the lower y-endstop even if the bed is mounted a few mm higher (i.e. due to leveling screws)
* figuring out something cool for the "i3" logo that is more universal in terms of milling. The "i3" is too fine for a 3mm tool, so many people seem to just mill "Prusa". If Josef allows it, I'll write Proosha III on it, giving the build a linguistic educational flavor :).
